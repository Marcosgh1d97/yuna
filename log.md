  * 2015-09-25: Ordered my yuna on [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/351398651121) for 412,13 EUR (444,30 USD delivery included).
  * 2015-10-08: My laptop arrived but I were not at home
  * 2015-10-09:
    * I picked up my laptop. I had to pay 31,31 â‚¬ for commons (see [Costs](https://github.com/somenxavier/yuna/blob/master/Costs.md))
    * I login with my gmail username.
    * I write the specs of my model down (see [Model](https://github.com/somenxavier/yuna/blob/master/Specs.md) page). 
    * I can't install the [Chrome Recover Utility](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromebook-recovery-utili/jndclpdbaamdhonoechobihbbiimdgai) because of `Network_Failed` error. After [asking it](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/chromebook-central/KBUywqBgbOI/vr2KWLPgBgAJ;context-place=topicsearchin/chromebook-central/somenxavier), I knew it was the type of connection: the laptop was connected to a ad-blocking network. After connecting to my router directly, all was fine.
  * 2015-10-10: I used the Google Recovery Utility to make a backup. The important in this step is that the `ID` of the laptop is the same of the `chrome:system`, that is, `YUNA D25-A3B-L4A-A9C`.
